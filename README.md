## Course Section
- CSCE 3600.003 (8175)

## Description
This project implements several bitwise operations, such as:
- Power of 2
- Reverse Bits
- Replace Bit Position from a Mask
- Check if a Binary Representation is a Palindrome

The operations are implemented in separate C files and use bitwise operators for data manipulation.

## Project Organization
- **major1.h**: Header file containing function declarations.
- **major1.c**: Main file that displays a menu and calls the respective operation based on user input.
- **power.c**: Contains the implementation of the Power of 2 operation.
- **reverse.c**: Contains the implementation of the Reverse Bits operation.
- **replace.c**: Contains the implementation of the Replace Bit Position operation.
- **palindrome.c**: Contains the implementation of the Palindrome check.

## Roles and Responsibilities
Each group member was responsible for one of the following operations:
- **Power of 2**: Snehitha Paruchuri
- **Reverse Bits**: [Dylan Throckmorton]
- **Replace Bit Position**: Veronica Fuentes
- **Palindrome Check**: Syeda Zainab

## Compilation
To compile the project, simply run the following command:
gcc major1.c palindrome.c power.c reverse.c replace.c
```bash
make
